Game of Life in JS
====================

A cellular automaton visualization devised by the British mathematician John H. Conway.

The rules are as follows:
<ol>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.<ol>
<ol>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.<ol>
<ol>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.<ol>
<ol>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<ol>
